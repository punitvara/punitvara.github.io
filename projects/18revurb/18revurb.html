<h5>Urban Form Performance Analysis using Temporal Telecom Data</h5>
<br>
<p>This study explores a novel method to analyze diverse behavioral patterns in large urban population and to associate them
    with discrete urban features. Through this coupling, this work aims to suggest correlations between human dynamics and
    the characteristics of urban places: Which city form has greater potential to attract large, heterogeneous and diverse
    crowds? What amenities, services and urban features produce highly active urban places? And what keeps us staying at
    a specific street corner for several minutes or hours?

        Urban environments are inherently temporal: they contain static artifacts (buildings, roads, public or open spaces) that
        are staged to support dynamic activities (movements, traffic, commerce or stay). For centuries, planners, developers
        and governments were investigating these relationships in an attempt to improve the design and performance of successful
        urban spaces [Krier, 1979]. Nevertheless, more empirical analysis of users engagement with urban environments has
        always been challenging: [Gehl, 2013; Ã‡olak, et al. 2015] Lack of data and scarcity of tools left room for unproven
        assessments, sometimes leading to poor decision-making. But recent advancements in data and machine learning carry
        a promise to potentially reverse this approach: instead of looking at the form to infer behavior, can we look at
        behavior and potentially suggest urban form?
