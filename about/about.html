Since younger days, I have been curious about computers. Later I joined electronics degree and got interested about building robots, designing PCBs. It was absolute fun to program electronic circuits and see blinkind LED or robots moving automatically. Hunger to learn more about electronics led me to pursue masters degree in embedded systems and VLSI, where my journey to open source started after contributing to Linux Kernel.
